File descriptions:
draw_graph: Used to plot graphs.
find_lambda: Used to find the optimal set of lambda values for the control law in the second-order system with unmatched disturbances.
find_norm: Computes the norm of the vector || (Q[k+1] - Q[k]) d||
index_converge: Determines the convergence time for the first-order system
first_order: Simulation of the first-order system.
firt_order: Simulation of the first-order system when the disturbance matrix no longer satisfies the persistency of excitation (PE) condition.
second_order_matched-disturbance: Simulation of the second-order system with matched disturbances and a disturbance matrix that satisfies the PE condition.
second-order_matched_disturbance_not_PE: Simulation of the second-order system with matched disturbances but a disturbance matrix that does not satisfy the PE condition.
second_order_unmatched-disturbance: Simulation of the second-order system with unmatched disturbances and a disturbance matrix that satisfies the PE condition.
